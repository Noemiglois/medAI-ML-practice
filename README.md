Artificial intelligence plays an increasingly vital role in the medical field. Research into Machine Learning (ML) methods supporting clinical decision-making is in high demand among healthcare professionals, as effective methods could expedite disease diagnosis, thereby enhancing patients' quality of life. The purpose of this project is to create a practical framework for applying various ML techniques to the mammographic mass dataset sourced from the UCI repository (available [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/161/mammographic+mass)).

This project is structured into 5 jupyter notebooks, covering a wide range of ML concepts. It begins with a detailed analysis of the dataset, including description, preprocessing, and data partitioning (EDA.ipynb). Subsequent chapters focus on supervised (classification.ipynb and regression.ipynb) and unsupervised learning tasks (unsupervised.ipynb). Finally, the project delves into the implementation of multilayer perceptrons and SVM using Python (ANN-SVM.ipynb), primarily leveraging Jupyter Notebooks and the Scikit-learn library.
